## Getting streamdeck_ui set up for local development
The first step when contributing to any project is getting it set up on your local machine. streamdeck_ui aims to make this as simple as possible.

Account Requirements:

- [A valid GitHub account](https://github.com/join)

Base System Requirements:

- Python3.8+
- poetry
- bash or a bash compatible shell (should be auto-installed on Linux / Mac)

Once you have verified that you system matches the base requirements you can start to get the project working by following these steps:

1. [Fork the project on GitHub](https://github.com/timothycrosley/streamdeck_ui/fork).
2. Clone your fork to your local file system:
    `git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_ACCOUNT/streamdeck_ui.git`
3. `cd streamdeck_ui
4. `poetry install`
5. `poetry run streamdeck` will launch the local project.

## Making a contribution
Congrats! You're now ready to make a contribution! Use the following as a guide to help you reach a successful pull-request:

1. Check the [issues page](https://github.com/timothycrosley/streamdeck_ui/issues) on GitHub to see if the task you want to complete is listed there.
    - If it's listed there, write a comment letting others know you are working on it.
    - If it's not listed in GitHub issues, go ahead and log a new issue. Then add a comment letting everyone know you have it under control.
        - If you're not sure if it's something that is good for the main streamdeck_ui project and want immediate feedback, you can discuss it [here](https://gitter.im/timothycrosley/streamdeck-ui).
2. Create an issue branch for your local work `git checkout -b issue/$ISSUE-NUMBER`.
3. Do your magic here.

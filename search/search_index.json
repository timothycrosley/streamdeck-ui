Key Features Linux Compatible : Enables usage of all Stream Deck devices on Linux without needing to code. Multi-device : Enables connecting and configuring multiple Stream Deck devices on one computer. Brightness Control : Supports controlling the brightness from both the configuration UI and buttons on the device itself. Configurable Button Display : Icons + Text, Icon Only, and Text Only configurable per button on the Stream Deck. Multi-Action Support : Run commands, write text and press hotkey combinations at the press of a single button on your Stream Deck. Button Pages : streamdeck_ui supports multiple pages of buttons and dynamically setting up buttons to switch between those pages. Auto Reconnect : Automatically and gracefully reconnects, in the case the device is unplugged and replugged in. Import/Export : Supports saving and restoring Stream Deck configuration. Communication with the Streamdeck is powered by the Python Elgato Stream Deck Library . Linux Quick Start Python 3.8 is required. You can check which version you have installed with python3 --version . Precooked Scripts There are scripts for setting up streamdeck_ui on Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora . Manual installation To use streamdeck_ui on Linux, you will need first to install some prerequisite system libraries. The name of those libraries will differ depending on your Operating System. Debian / Ubuntu: sudo apt install python3-pip libhidapi-libusb0 libxcb-xinerama0 Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-pip python3-devel hidapi If you're using GNOME shell, you might need to manually install an extension that adds KStatusNotifierItem/AppIndicator Support to make the tray icon show up. To use streamdeck_ui without root permissions, you have to give your user full access to the device. Add the udev rules using the nano text editor: sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-streamdeck.rules Paste the following line and write the file: SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0fd9\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" Make the new rule take effect: sudo udevadm trigger Installing the application itself is done via pip: pip3 install streamdeck-ui --user Make sure to include $HOME/.local/bin to your PATH. If you haven't already, add PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin to the bottom your shell config file (most likely .bashrc in your home directory). You can then launch streamdeck to start configuring your device. streamdeck It's recommended that you include streamdeck in your windowing environment's list of applications to auto-start. If you would like to start it without the user interface shown, use streamdeck -n . Generic Quick Start On other Operating Systems, you'll need to install the required dependencies of the library. After that, use pip to install the app: pip3 install streamdeck-ui --user streamdeck See the guide for * CentOS * Fedora * Ubuntu 18.04 Help Command Enter a value in the command field to execute a command. For example, gnome-terminal will launch a new terminal on Ubuntu/Fedora or obs will launch OBS. Some examples (Ubuntu) You can use a tool like xdotool to interact with other applications. Find the window with a title starting with Meet - and bring it to focus. This helps if you have a Google Meet session on a tab somewhere but you lost it behind another window. xdotool search --name '^Meet - .+$' windowactivate The meeting tab must be active one if you have multiple tabs open, since the window title is set by the currently active tab. Find the window with a title starting with Meet - and then send ctrl+d to it. This has the effect of toggling the mute button in Google Meet. xdotool search --name '^Meet - .+$' windowactivate --sync key ctrl+d Change the system volume up (or down) by a certain percentage. Assumes you're using PulseAudio/Alsa Mixer. amixer -D pulse sset Master 20%+ If you want you invoke a command that uses shell-script specific things like && or | , run it via bash. This command will shift focus to firefox using the wmctrl , and then shifts focus to the first tab: bash -c \"wmctrl -a firefox && xdotool key alt+1\" Press Keys Simulates key press combinations (hot keys). The basic format is a group of keys, separated by a + sign to press simultaneously. Separate key combination groups with a , if additional key combinations are needed. For example, alt+F4,f means press and hold alt , followed by F4 and then release both. Next, press and release f . You can also specify a KeyCode in hex format, for example, 0x74 is the KeyCode for t . This is also sometimes called the keysym value. You can use the xev tool and capture the key you are looking for. In the output, look for the keysym hex value , for example (keysym 0x74, t) Use comma or plus if you want to actually output , or + respectively. Use delay <n> to add a delay, where <n> is the number (float or integer) of seconds to delay. If <n> is not specified, 0.5 second default is used. If <n> fails to parse as a valid number, it will result in no delay. Examples F11 - Press F11. If you have focus on a browser, this will toggle full screen. alt+F4 - Closes the current window. ctrl+w - Closes the current browser tab. cmd+left - View split on left. Note cmd is the super key (equivalent of the Windows key). alt+plus - Presses the alt and the + key at the same time. alt+delay+F4 - Press alt, then wait 0.5 seconds, then press F4. Release both. 1,delay,delay,2,delay,delay,3 - Type 123 with a 1-second delay between key presses (using default delay). 1,delay 1,2,delay 1,3 - Type 123 with a 1-second delay between key presses (using custom delay). e,c,h,o,space,\",t,e,s,t,\",enter - Type echo \"test\" and press enter. ctrl+alt+0x74 - Opens a new terminal window. 0x74 is the KeyCode for t . TIP: If the character doesn't work, try using the KeyCode instead. 0xffe5 - Toggle Caps Lock. 0xffaf - The / key on the numeric key pad. The standard list of keys can be found at the source . The super key (Windows key) can be problematic on some versions of Linux. Instead of using the Key Press feature, you could use the Command feature as follows. In this example, it will press Super and 4 , which launches application number 4 in your favorites (Ubuntu). xdotool key \"Super_L+4\" Write Text: A quick way of typing longer pieces of text (verbatim). Note that unlike the Press Keys action, write text does not accept special (modifier) keys. However, if you type Enter (causing a new line) it will press enter during the output. Examples Unfortunately that ' s a hard no . Kind regards , Joe Known issues Confirm you are running the latest release with pip3 show streamdeck-ui . Compare it to: Streamdeck uses pynput for simulating Key Presses but it lacks proper support for Wayland . Generally your results will be good when using X (Ubuntu/Linux Mint). This thread may be useful. Key Press or Write Text does not work on Fedora (outside of the streamdeck itself), which is not particularly useful. However, still do a lot with the Command feature. Version 1.0.2 lacks error handling when executing Command and Key Press actions. As a result, you have to be careful - an invalid command or key press makes everything else also stop working. Please upgrade to the latest version. Some users have reported that the Stream Deck device does not work on all on specific USB ports, as it draws quite a bit of power and/or has strict bandwidth requirements . Try a different port. If you are executing a shell script from the Command feature - remember to add the shebang at the top of your file, for the language in question. #!/bin/bash or #!/usr/bin/python3 etc. The streamdeck may appear to lock up if you don't under some distros.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#key-features","text":"Linux Compatible : Enables usage of all Stream Deck devices on Linux without needing to code.

Eigenschaften Linux Kompatibel : Erm\u00f6glicht die Nutzung aller Stream Deck Ger\u00e4te mit Linux ohne code zu ben\u00f6tigen. Mehrere Ger\u00e4te : Erm\u00f6glicht die Verbindung und Konfiguration mehrere Stream Deck Ger\u00e4te an einem Computer. Helligkeits-Steuerung : Unterst\u00fctzt die Einstellung der Helligkeit von der Konfigurations-Oberfl\u00e4che und den Kn\u00f6pfen am Ger\u00e4t selbst. Konfigurierbares Tastenbild : Icon + Text, nur Icon und nur Text sind pro Taste des Stream Decks konfigurierbar. Multi-Action Unterst\u00fctzung : Kommandos starten, Text schreiben und Hotkey-Kombinationen dr\u00fccken mit einem einzigen Tastendruck auf dem Stream Deck. Tasten-Seiten : streamdeck_ui bietet mehrere Seiten von Tasten mit dynamischer Einstellung von Tasten zum Umschalten zwischen ihnen. Automatisches Wiederverbinden : Das Ger\u00e4t wird automatisch und problemlos wieder verbunden, falls das Ger\u00e4t ab- und wieder angesteckt wurde. Import/Export : Bietet das Abspeichern und Wiederherstellen ganzer Stream Deck Konfigurationen. Die Kommunikation mit dem Streamdeck erfolgt durch die Python Elgato Stream Deck Library . Linux Schnellstart Python 3.8 wird ben\u00f6tigt. Sie k\u00f6nnen die Version, die sie installiert haben, \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen mit python3 --version . Vorgefertigte Skripte Es gibt fertige Skripte um streamdeck_ui auf Debian/Ubuntu und Fedora zu installieren. Manuelle Installation Um streamdeck_ui unter Linux zu verwenden, m\u00fcssen einige System-Bibliotheken als Voraussetzung installiert werden. Die Namen dieser Bibliotheken k\u00f6nnen, abh\u00e4ngig von ihrem Betriebssystem, variieren. Debian / Ubuntu: sudo apt install python3-pip libhidapi-libusb0 libxcb-xinerama0 Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-pip python3-devel hidapi Wenn sie die GNOME shell verwenden, k\u00f6nnten sie eine Erweiterung, die den KStatusNotifierItem/AppIndicator Support bietet, manuell installieren m\u00fcssen um das Tray-Icon anzuzeigen. Um streamdeck_ui ohne root-Rechte zu benutzen, m\u00fcssen sie ihrem user vollen Zugriff auf das Ger\u00e4t erlauben. F\u00fcgen sie die folgenden udev rules mit Hilfe ihres Editors hinzu: sudoedit /etc/udev/rules.d/70-streamdeck.rules # Wenn das nicht funktioniert, versuchen sie: sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-streamdeck.rules F\u00fcgen sie die folgenden Zeilen ein: SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0fd9\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" Aktivieren sie die Regeln: sudo udevadm trigger Die Installation der Anwendung selbst erfolgt via pip: pip3 install streamdeck-ui --user Stellen sie sicher, dass $HOME/.local/bin in ihrem PATH enthalten ist. Wenn das nicht der Fall ist, f\u00fcgen sie PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin an das Ende ihrer shell Konfigurationsdatei (wahrscheinlich .bashrc in ihrem home directory) hinzu. Jetzt k\u00f6nnen sie streamdeck starten um mit der Konfiguration zu beginnen. streamdeck Es wird empfohlen streamdeck in die Autostart-Liste ihrer Fenster-Umgebung aufzunehmen. Wenn sie es verwenden wollen ohne dass das Benutzer-Interface angezeigt wird, verwenden sie streamdeck -n . Allgemeiner Schnellstart Auf anderen Betriebssystemen m\u00fcssen sie die ben\u00f6tigten Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten der Bibliothek installieren. Danach verwenden sie pip zur Installation der Anwendung: pip3 install streamdeck-ui --user streamdeck Beachten sie auch die Anleitungen f\u00fcr * CentOS 7 * Ubuntu 18.04 Hilfe Befehl (Command) Geben sie einen Befehl in das Feld \"Command\" ein, um ihn auszuf\u00fchren. In Ubuntu/Fedora starten sie ein Terminal mit gnome-terminal , obs startet OBS. Beispiele (Ubuntu) Sie k\u00f6nnen ein tool wie xdotool verwenden, um mit anderen Programmen zu interagieren. Finden sie das Fenster, das mit Meet - beginnt, und setzen sie den Fokus darauf. Das hilft ihnen, wenn sie eine Google Meet Sitzung auf irgend einem Tab haben, die aber hinter anderen Fenstern verloren gegangen ist. xdotool search --name '^Meet - .+$' windowactivate Der Meeting-Tab muss aktiv sein wenn sie mehrere Tabs offen haben, da der Fenstertitel vom derzeit aktiven Tab gesetzt wird. Finden sie das Fenster, das mit Meet - beginnt, und senden sie ctrl+d dorthin. Das bewirkt das Umschalten der Stummschaltung (mute button) in Google Meet. xdotool search --name '^Meet - .+$' windowactivate --sync key ctrl+d Drehen sie die System-Lautst\u00e4rke um einen gewissen Prozentsatz hoch (oder runter). Wir nehmen an, sie verwenden PulseAudio/Alsa Mixer. amixer -D pulse sset Master 20%+ Wenn sie einen Befehl abgeben wollen der shell-script spezifische Dinge wie && oder | enth\u00e4lt, dann starten sie ihn via bash. Dieser Befehl wird de Fokus auf Firefox setzen, indem es wmctrl nutzt, und dann den Fokus auf den ersten Tab verschieben: bash -c \"wmctrl -a firefox && xdotool key alt+1\" Tasten dr\u00fccken Simuliert Tasten-Kombinationen (hot keys). Grunds\u00e4tzlich werden Tasten, die gleichzeitig bet\u00e4tigt werden, mit einem + Zeichen verbunden. Trennen sie Tasten-Kombinationen mit einem , , wenn zus\u00e4tzliche Kombinationen ben\u00f6tigt werden. Die Zeichenfolge alt+F4,f zum Beispiel bedeutet dr\u00fccke und halte alt , gefolgt von F4 und lass dann beide los. Dr\u00fccke anschlie\u00dfend f und lass es wieder los. Sie k\u00f6nnen auch einen Tasten-Code im hex Format verwenden, 0x74 ist zum Beispiel der Tasten-Code f\u00fcr t . Dieser Wert wird auch manchmal als keysym bezeichnet.

Beachten sie, dass anders als in der Tastendruck-Funtion, hier keine Spezial-(Modifikations-)Tasten akzeptiert werden.

There is no perfect number: but for Hug, we've decided to cap the lines at 100 characters. Descriptive Variable names Naming things is hard. Hug has a few strict guidelines on the usage of variable names, which hopefully will reduce some of the guesswork: - No one character variable names. - Except for x, y, and z as coordinates. - It's not okay to override built-in functions. - Except for id . Guido himself thought that shouldn't have been moved to the system module. It's too commonly used, and alternatives feel very artificial. - Avoid Acronyms, Abbreviations, or any other short forms - unless they are almost universally understand.

If the modules are meant only for internal use within the project, they should be prefixed with a leading underscore. For example, def _internal_function. Modules should contain a docstring at the top that gives a general explanation of the purpose and then restates the project's use of the MIT license.

Our Pledge In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Our Standards Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include: Using welcoming and inclusive language Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences Gracefully accepting constructive criticism Focusing on what is best for the community Showing empathy towards other community members Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include: The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Our Responsibilities Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Scope This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers. Enforcement Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting timothy.crosley@gmail.com . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Confidentiality will be maintained with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
